                            Google in Australia for a year! She smart smart.

                                When I was her TA for data science, she once walked up to me in St. Mary's looked me in
                                the
                                eyes,
                                and then awkwardly plopped a
                                USB stick in my hand. She said, "I don't know if other groups had this problem, but we
                                had
                                too much
                                data to upload, so our whole
                                project is on this stick. Please don't lose it." Needless to say, their project was a
                                nightmare to
                                grade, but it was solid.

    <h5>Notes about Bootstrap:</h5>
    <ul class="list-group-numbered list-group-flush">
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Use Bootstrap for the layout of websites. The rest doesn't really matter,
            but the tools it provides for creating a layout are incredible.</strong></li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Built for mobile devices first, works on everything thanks to "breakpoints." Give a
            breakpoint to an element and it limits the size of the element up to a certain size of device. Check em out
            if you're building a real website.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Containers. The go-to class for divs. Sets the maximum width of a div nicely,
            "contains" everything else. Throw one of these down and you're off to the races.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Use the grid system. It's insanely helpful for placing content in the right spot.
            This was a nightmare pre-Bootstrap.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Images used to be awful to deal with before Bootstrap. There are classes you can use
            on images to make them play nice in whatever box you put them in.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Bootstrap tables are next level. Super easy to build, and almost as easy to
            customize. I have used these in production-level code and they do not disappoint.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Bootstrap forms are almost as awesome as tables. They are really easy to use, forms
            are especially hard to mess with without Bootstrap because there are so many different pieces of them.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">"Components" are pre-made... widgets... that you can use by just copy-pasting.
            Examples of this are the navbar, accordion, and even this list. They are super convenient and Bootstrap has
            an answer for just about every situation you can think of. Go find your favorite.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">All of the stuff in this list and a lot more can be found in the <a
                href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/">docs</a>. The docs are super easy
            to understand and pretty much everything in there can be mix-and-matched however you want.
